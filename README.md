# CryptoPy 🔐
A Python module to easily encrypt and decrypt files.

CryptoPy is written in Python 3.7 🐍

## Example Usage

CryptoPy currently uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt files.

By default, if the user doesn't supply a `KEY` to `CryptoPy`, a random key is generated and used for encryption.
However, if a `KEY` is supplied, the assumption is made that this `KEY` is stored or known to the user by some other means.

The `KEY` must be a byte string. An example is: `b'\xcd\xa0\x0f\x97%.\xbb\xf7\xe0\xd3\xa9\x86i\xec\xa0:'`.

Below shows an example of CryptoPy in action on a file within this project.

```python
# encrypt_file ONLY returns a string PATH to the key file if a key isn't supplied during initialisation.
key_file_path = CryptoPy().encrypt_file("./Pipfile.lock")
print(key_file_path)
# Open the file containing the key generated by CryptoPy during encryption process.
# Remember, this file is only produced if no `KEY` was supplied during initialisation of CryptoPy.
with open("./Pipfile.lock.key", "rb") as key_file:
    key = key_file.read()
# Use the key to decrypt the previously encrypted file.
# decrypt_file returns a string PATH to the decrypted file.
decrypted_file_path = CryptoPy(key).decrypt_file("./Pipfile.lock.enc")
print(decrypted_file_path)
```
